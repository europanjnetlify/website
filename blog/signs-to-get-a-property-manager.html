        Let’s face it: finding a property manager can feel like hiring a babysitter for your house. Except instead of
        bedtime stories, they’re dealing with plumbing disasters and lease agreements. So how do you know if you’ve
        found “the one”?

        Here’s what to look for—and what should send you running.

        ✅ Sign #1: They Answer Calls—Even When Nothing’s on Fire

        This one’s easy. Do they call you back? Do they pick up before the fourth voicemail? Responsiveness isn’t just a
        courtesy—it’s how problems get solved before they become expensive.

        ✅ Sign #2: They Know the Market Like the Back of Their Clipboard

        A good manager won’t just nod and smile—they’ll tell you why your unit should rent for $2,350 instead of $2,500,
        what tenants are looking for this season, and whether white cabinets are still in (spoiler: yes, for now).

        ✅ Sign #3: Tenants Actually Like Them

        Look, tenants don’t need to send thank-you cards. But if your manager keeps lease renewals high and complaints
        low? That’s gold. Happy tenants = fewer vacancies = more money for you.

        ✅ Sign #4: They're Weirdly Obsessed With Systems

        From online rent portals to 24/7 maintenance tracking, the best property managers are system nerds. If they
        light up while explaining how they handle move-outs? You’re in good hands.

        ✅ Sign #5: You Forget You Own the Property—In a Good Way

        The ultimate test. If your rental just “works,” and your bank account grows quietly in the background… that’s a
        sign you’ve hit the jackpot.

        🚩 Red Flag #1: They’re Vague About Fees

        If you ask what they charge and they suddenly turn into a magician—lots of hand-waving, no clear answer—walk
        away. Transparency is everything.

        🚩 Red Flag #2: They Blame Everyone Else

        “The tenants are the problem.” “The plumber’s lazy.” “The city is impossible.” If it’s always someone else’s
        fault, they’re probably not taking responsibility—and that never ends well.

        Gut Check: How’s Your Manager Doing?

        If your current team isn’t ticking most of those boxes, or if the red flags are hitting too close to home, maybe
        it’s time for a switch.

        Or at least… a conversation.
